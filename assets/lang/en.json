  "project1_more": "Learn more",
  "project1_desc_long": "This project is a fully local, explainable moderation pipeline that scrapes reviews, detects harmful content using BERT, generates smart summaries with T5, and rewrites toxic comments for publication — all with no external API. It includes a Streamlit dashboard and a FastAPI backend, and is designed to be modular, privacy-preserving, and production-ready.",
